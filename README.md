# COMPSCI-760-Stress-recognition-in-automobile-drivers
We use physiological signs to gauge the pressing factor of drivers.

In this examination, the driving show included a set way through more than 20 miles of open roads in the more essential Boston 
locale and a lot of rules for drivers to follow. The upgrades of our research are as per the following: first, fitting a period series 
dependent on the sensor reaction during the time span; second, checking if the time series is ordinary; third, tracking down the unusual timespan 
and afterward see the anomalies as result.
